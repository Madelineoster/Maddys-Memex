it is interesting to look at how much telegraphy opened the world up for globalization and everything that comes along with it. It can be negative (colonialism, control and imperialism) but also positive (access to new cultures and communication between them). I wonder how this impacted the development of other means of communication, and if they had similar globalization implications?
