Luigi Menabrea provides a simplified explanation of the Analytical Engine here;

"Suffice it to say that, thank to it, you could perform the series of analytical and numerical operations needed to solve a given problem, in the same way that the Jacquard loom, using perforated cards, executes designs on brocade." [[@brucesterlingluigifedericomenabreapayingtributetoadalovelace]]
