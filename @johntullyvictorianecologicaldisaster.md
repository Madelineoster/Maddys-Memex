### Summary & Key Take Aways

In “A Victorian Ecological Disaster: Imperialism, the Telegraph, and Gutta-Percha.” (2009), John Tully explains the exploititive colonial history of the telegraph, and how this caused the destruction of tropical rainforests for the furthering of communication and control among empires. Tully makes this clear through a chronological history of the telegraph and the state of the world at its development and invention, with a main focus on the material Gutta-Percha, and the exploitation and overuse of it. Overall, Tully explores this history in order to stress the unethical and imperialistic nature of it and the global and environmental impact that we can still see today.
