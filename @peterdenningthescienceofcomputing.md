### Summary & Key Take Aways

In "the Science of Computing"(1989), Peter J Denning discusses the influence and history of the ARPANET. Denning explains how The Arpanet began as an experiment in resource sharing among computers in 1969, evolving into a world  network of over 60,000 nodes, and influencing other networks in business, education, and government.
