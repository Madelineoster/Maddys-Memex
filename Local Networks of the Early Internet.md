I found Kevin Driscoll's discussion in "Birth of the Modem World" of the many people involved in the early internet through highly local networks of PC's highly fascinating. The online communities that shaped the early internet, that are rarely present in the origin story of the internet, are an influential part of this vast history. While not always the best, as Driscoll mentions, with white supremacy, misogyny and racism a large part of these local networks, these groups did allow for the powerful sense of community that the internet offers, and it is important to include them in these histories. It is one of the unique and dominant aspects of the internet; being able to connect with likeminded people and form communities where people can feel included where they dont always in real life.
