#idea #question 
I wonder what the future of AI will bring? Will it be the popularily feared takeover of tech too intelligent for mere humans to control? Will it be further adjusted to aid in every facet of life? Or will people come to a realization of its possible dangers and shut it down alltogether? I believe the awnser lies in whatever the majority power decides, but it is intersting to ponder as it will most likely happen in our lifetime and depending on what happens, could drastically alter human life.
