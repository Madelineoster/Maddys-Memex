The most powerful thing I learned in this class was just how long, complicated, misunderstood, unethical and transformative the history of the internet is, and how the internet cannot even begin to be understood without the immense background of every speck of technology that preceeded and made its conception possible. This was made clear as well as just how many minds, actions and people behind the scenes it takes for the acomplishment of technological advancement, most of which never see credit. This was stressed immensely throughout the lectures and in some of the more critical readings, but the history of the internet remains an almost impossible concept to fully discern because of the web of interlocking factors that impact its existence. As for learning based skills, I learned of the importance of effectively reading and annotating academic sources, as well as cross referencing said sources to create a more fully formed critical idea of topics and how they relate to eachother.
