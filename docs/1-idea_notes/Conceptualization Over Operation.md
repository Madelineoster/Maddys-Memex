The way humans think about history can be so dependant on the narratives spun by powerful figures and the mainstream thought processes around certain topics. As discussed in "The Myth of the World Wide Web", the webs birthday is celebrated on the day of its conception rather than the day of its actual operation. This is interesting and I wonder why we often mark the invention of things at the earliest point we can over the factual date of creation, after everything was actually fully figured out? In a far off way this reminds me of the Womens right movement in how we celebrate suffrage as when women first got the right to vote, when it was only white women that got that right, and it took decades for women of all races to vote.
