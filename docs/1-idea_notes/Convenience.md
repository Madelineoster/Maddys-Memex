The whole concept of convenience has been so interestingly altered by technology, more specifically AI. To be able to simply speak to something and have it do what you want is hard to imagine. And the ways this alters our lifestyle is profound. Whether this impact is negative or positive is the question. Does it foster laziness and a lack of real interaction with the world? Or does it simply make the more menial tasks of life easier, allowing for people to put their time and attention to other, possibly more productive, tasks? Only time ill tell, and every person interacts with technology and convenience differently, but personally I have found a negative impact, as I feel dependant on technology and find it distracting to real life and find myslef becoming less self sufficient and able.
