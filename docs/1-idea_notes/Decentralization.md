I find it difficul to wrap my head on the more technological aspects of the internet and more interested in the cultural influence of it, but 'the Evolution of the Internet' provides a very clear representation of the organization components in the form of 'Decentralization'. The authors describe a decentralized "web" model of organization that is what allowsthe internet to store data in many different places at once making it useful for backing up data and hard to destroy data that might be unwanted.
