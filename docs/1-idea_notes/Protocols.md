The Protocols of the internet are a very interesting aspect of its organization that allow for a certain extent of control without a central command structure. This can be seen inÂ the development of rules of communication for computers that enable the machines to turn raw data into useful information developed through consensus by computer scientists to  control online communication and have shaped the way the Internet works. This is a very straightforward way of looking at the make up of the internet, and it is fascinating to look at how these strcutures have evolved over time. One example given by the authors of these Protocols is Facebook, another way to more easily understand these conceots and how things like facebook exist and were developed following these sets of rules and organization.
