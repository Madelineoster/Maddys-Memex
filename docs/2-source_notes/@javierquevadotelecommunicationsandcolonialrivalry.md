### Summary & Key Take Aways

In  “Telecommunications and Colonial Rivalry: European Telegraph Cables to the Canary Islands and Northwest Africa, 1883-1914.” (2010), Javier Quevado analyses the connections between telecommunications and colonialism. The author does this through discussion of the geopolitics and competition between European powers in taking control of Northwest Africa, and the role of the telegraph in this. Overall, Quevado emphasizes how marine telegraph cables became a subject of intense rivalry between Germany and the new Franco-British entente, in order to expose the imperialism that was everpresent in this history.
