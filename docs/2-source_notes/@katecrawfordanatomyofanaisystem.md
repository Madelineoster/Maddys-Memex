### Summary & Key Take Aways

In "Anatomy of an AI System"(2023), Kate Crawford explores the matrix of capacities involved in the making and working of an AI system. Crawford makes these capacities clear through an exploded view of a planetary system across birth, life and death, which becomes an anatomical map of an AI system. The chains of resource extraction, human labor and algorithmic processing across networks of mining, logistics, distribution, prediction and optimization are discussed and explained in order to allow us to grasp its immensity and complexity.
