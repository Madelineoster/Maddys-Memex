### Summary & Key Take Aways

In "The Early Part of History that People dont Talk About"(2022), kevin Driscoll discusses the true prehistory of the internet and the many misconceptions surrounding it. Driscoll explores this by adressing the uncertain definition of the internet for may, and the ideas that its origins trace to the government, the military, the Cold War and ARPANET. While Driscoll notes these as contributing factors, he looks to the numerous PC users who ran local networks and created online communites as the forgotten developers of the interent as we know it today. Driscoll raises these points in order to highlight a fuller history of the internet, especially how the modem world developed in parallel to the ARPANET family of networks, providing a more community oriented sphere of distinct social and technical activity.
