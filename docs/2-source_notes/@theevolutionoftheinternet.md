### Summary & Key Take Aways

In "the Evolution of the Internet"(2016), the author discusses the massive transformation that the internet has gone through as well as the elements that have persisted throughout its history, making it the decentralized, indestructable communication network it is today. The author explores these ideas with a chronological view of the internets evolution, adressing the many contributing building blocks, people and events necesary for its creation and development, from ARPANET, emails and hypertext to Geocities and social media. These influences are unpacked in order to stress the multitude of things that had to occur to bring about the internet that we know today.
