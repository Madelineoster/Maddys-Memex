The way histories are disseminated and widely thought of is quite interesting and based on many different things. Kevin Driscoll describes the reason why the internets folk histories are so narow and sometimes inacurrate as being because of an uncertain definition of 'the internet'. Even when I think of it, Im not entirely sure how I would describe or define the internet. Most of the academics or distributors of information who attempt to write on the internet are also not always sure of what it is, which makes it hard to discern credible information, something that has plagued the perceotion of the internet, as we think of it in the terms of how we personally interact with it and experience it. With something as fluid, far reaching and conflicting yet widely known of and used, as the internet, Thes issues are very prevalent.
