It is fascinating how conflict is such an influential force for progress in the technical world. In 'The Science of Computing', Peter Denning discusses the origins of the ARPANET story as beginning in the late fifties with the development of intercontinental balistic misiles, as the Department of Defense wanted to enforce the durability of communications networks in order to aid in survival of a first nuclear attack. War as a determiner of technological development has been present throughout history with necesary beneficial development of weapons, equipment, structures and vehicles, and more recently computing technology.
