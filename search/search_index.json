He also utilizes images, examples and definitions to further describe the topic. This chapter stresses the very human tendency of secrecy and yearning for privacy that is only amplified as the languages and mediums we use to communicate become more and more complex. </p>"},{"location":"3-atomic_notes/2-source_notes/%40johnfdooleyarevolutionarycipher/#links","title":"Links","text":"<p>Mediums as a Means of Deciphering</p> <p>Power and knowledge</p> <p>Privacy then vs now</p>"},{"location":"3-atomic_notes/2-source_notes/%40lisagitelmanmediaashistoricalsubjects/","title":"@lisagitelmanmediaashistoricalsubjects","text":"<p>Title: @lisagitelmanmediaashistoricalsubjects Date: {{2/10/23}} Type: Reference</p>"},{"location":"3-atomic_notes/2-source_notes/%40lisagitelmanmediaashistoricalsubjects/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<p>Gitelman, Lisa. \u201cIntroduction: Media as Historical Subjects.\u201d MIT Press, July 21, 2006. https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4377/chapter/187467/Introduction-Media-as-Historical-Subjects.</p>"},{"location":"3-atomic_notes/2-source_notes/%40lisagitelmanmediaashistoricalsubjects/#summary-and-key-notes","title":"Summary and Key Notes","text":"<p>In this introduction titled; Media as Historical Subjects (2006), Lisa Gitelman examines the ways that media are studied as historical subjects.
